                        <h3>What is SAIL?</h3>
                        <p>
                            SAIL (Student AI Literacy) Fridays are weekly drop-in sessions where faculty 
                            come together to explore AI integration in teaching and learning. These sessions 
                            focus on hands-on problem-solving: bring your challenge, and we'll workshop AI 
                            approaches together.

                        <h3>Why Context Matters</h3>
                        <p>
                            Prompts without context lose their value. That's why this library focuses on 
                            the full story: <strong>What problem were you solving?</strong> 
                            <strong>How did you approach it?</strong> <strong>What was the outcome?</strong>

                            We believe in learning by doing. SAIL Fridays combine experiential learning 
                            with a shared resource library, so you can both participate in live sessions 
                            and explore examples on your own time.

                                    Students in a business ethics course were struggling to engage with 
                                    multiple perspectives on complex ethical dilemmas. Traditional discussion 
                                    formats weren't generating the depth of analysis needed.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Created an AI "student" persona that takes a specific position on ethical 
                                    issues. Students must engage with this AI character, challenge its reasoning, 
                                    and defend alternative viewpoints.
                                </p>

                                <h4>🤖 The Prompt</h4>
                                <div class="prompt-box">
                                    <pre>You are a business student in an ethics course who strongly believes that 
[SPECIFIC POSITION]. When presented with ethical dilemmas, you always 
argue from this perspective. Your responses should:
- Be well-reasoned but somewhat narrow in scope
- Challenge students to think beyond your position
- Ask probing questions that reveal assumptions
- Occasionally concede points when students make compelling arguments

Engage with the following scenario: [SCENARIO]</pre>

                                    Students reported deeper engagement with ethical reasoning. The AI's 
                                    consistent perspective forced them to articulate their own positions 
                                    more clearly. Class discussions became more structured and substantive.

                                    Providing detailed, rubric-aligned feedback on student assignments was 
                                    time-consuming. Faculty needed a way to generate initial feedback that 
                                    could be reviewed and personalized.

                                    Developed a prompt that uses the course rubric as the evaluation framework. 
                                    The AI generates structured feedback that faculty can then review, edit, 
                                    and personalize before sending to students.

                                    Faculty saved 40-60% of time on initial feedback generation while 
                                    maintaining quality. The rubric-based approach ensured consistency

                                    Students in an analytics course had varying backgrounds. Some needed
